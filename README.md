# Stock market data analysis project aiming to model flucuations in the NASDAQ and return estimations on future pricings and valuations based on deep learning

This is my first machine learning project using various python packages such as Numpy, Tensorflow, pytorch, pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn
All of this is using psuedo "paper" money from the Alpaca API. This is a personal educational project to better my understanding of machine learning and something I find very interesting--the stock market. 
I will be using mostly jupyter notebook
Terminal pushs and pulls
The goal is to have a fully functional webpage and AI that executes trades and accounts for various market indicators like inflation, data scraping, and utilizing data analysis techniques
